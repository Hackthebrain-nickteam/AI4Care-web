## Core Features:

- Symptom Analysis: Analyze patient-provided symptom descriptions using clinical NLP and a symptoms database to assess the urgency of the case.
- Urgency Triage: Determine urgency level (red, yellow, green) based on the analyzed symptoms, providing a tool with reasoned assessment.
- Outcome Display: Present the triage outcome to the patient with clear, actionable recommendations. Provide supporting explanation of AI's decision
- Resource Navigation: Provide links and resources to inform further action such as connecting with telehealth or going to an appropriate urgent care facility. Display wait times where available
- Symptom Input: Offer a simple form-based input for symptom descriptions to guide the patient. Examples will include options to describe 'level of pain', 'type of pain' etc
- Interaction Logging: Implement data logging mechanism (can be simple local storage in MVP) to store anonymized patient interactions and triage outcomes to enable debugging of AI over time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2C3E50) to convey trust and professionalism.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F0F4F8), almost white, to provide a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#3498DB) for interactive elements and key information, ensuring visibility without being alarming.
